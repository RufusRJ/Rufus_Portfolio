            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am Rufus Nicholas Ebenezer, a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) student specializing in Information Technology. Currently in my second year of study, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles with a particular focus on web development, software engineering, and full-stack application design.

My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience in building real-world projects using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python (Flask), and MySQL. I am also familiar with modern frameworks and tools, and I continuously strive to stay updated with current industry trends.

In addition to my technical interests, I have a creative background in music production and video editing. This blend of analytical and artistic skill sets enables me to approach problem-solving with both structure and innovation.

I am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge, grow through collaboration, and contribute meaningfully to teams focused on building impactful digital solutions.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Working on the FPMS (FCRIT Placement Management System) was my first real experience building a full-stack web application that served a practical need. I learned how to plan a system from the ground upâ€”designing the database, writing backend logic, and creating a clean, user-friendly interface. It taught me how different parts of a system communicate and how to manage data securely and efficiently. On the other hand, creating the Solar System Emulation helped me think more visually and understand how programming can be used not just for solving problems, but also for simulating real-world phenomena in an interactive way. These projects pushed me to become more comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and gave me a solid foundation in building complete, functional applications with real use cases.</p>
